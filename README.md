# 🍵 MatchaCode - Daily LeetCode Challenge Tracker

A fun and motivating static website to track daily LeetCode challenges between friends, with a matcha-themed accountability system!

## 🌟 Features

- **Daily Challenge Tracking** - Mark your LeetCode problems as complete
- **Streak Counter** - Track your consecutive days of coding
- **Matcha Tracker** - Keep count of matcha owed when challenges are missed
- **Activity History** - See your recent progress
- **Simple Authentication** - Password-protected for just you and your friend
- **Responsive Design** - Works great on desktop and mobile
- **Local Storage** - Data persists between sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
3. **Enter the password**: `matcha2024`
4. **Start tracking** your daily LeetCode challenges!

## 🔐 Environment Variables & Security

The app now uses environment variables to keep the password secure and out of source code.

### Local Development
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` (optional for local dev)
2. Set your password: `MATCHACODE_PASSWORD=your-secure-password`
3. Run `npm run build:dev` to build with development settings

### Production Deployment
Set the environment variable `MATCHACODE_PASSWORD` in your deployment platform:

#### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `MATCHACODE_PASSWORD` with your secure password
3. Deploy - the build process will automatically use your environment variable

#### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `MATCHACODE_PASSWORD` with your secure password
3. Deploy - the build process will automatically use your environment variable

#### GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages doesn't support environment variables. For GitHub Pages:
1. Run `npm run build` locally with your password set
2. Commit the generated `config.js` file
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 📱 How to Use

1. **Login** with the shared password
2. **Mark Complete** when you finish today's LeetCode challenge
3. **Add Matcha Owed** if you miss a day (resets your streak)
4. **Track Progress** with the stats dashboard
5. **View History** of your challenges and matcha owed

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing the Theme
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css` to customize colors:

```css
/* Main gradient background */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Matcha green accent */
color: #4CAF50;
```

### Adding More Features
The app is built with vanilla JavaScript, making it easy to extend:

- Add difficulty levels for challenges
- Implement a points system
- Add more statistics
- Create weekly/monthly views

## 🚀 Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Deploy with zero configuration!

### Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in the project directory
3. Follow the prompts

### GitHub Pages
1. Push to a GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select source branch and deploy

## 🛠️ Technical Details
