# MatchaCode - LeetCode Challenge Tracker

## Project Overview
**MatchaCode** is a full-stack web application designed to gamify daily LeetCode practice between two developers, featuring real-time data synchronization, streak tracking, and a unique "matcha penalty" system to maintain motivation and accountability.

## Technical Achievements

### Frontend Development
- **Responsive Web Design**: Built a modern, mobile-first interface using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Interactive UI Components**: Implemented modal dialogs, authentication forms, and real-time status updates
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Applied contemporary UI trends with backdrop filters and gradient backgrounds
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensured consistent functionality across different browsers and devices

### Backend & Database Integration
- **Supabase Integration**: Implemented real-time PostgreSQL database connectivity using REST API
- **Data Synchronization**: Developed cross-device data consistency with automatic fallback to localStorage
- **Authentication System**: Built secure password-based authentication with environment variable configuration
- **API Development**: Created custom fetch-based client for seamless database operations

### Key Features Implemented
- **Streak Tracking Algorithm**: Developed complex logic to calculate consecutive daily challenge completions
- **Real-time Updates**: Implemented live data synchronization between multiple browser sessions
- **Activity History**: Built comprehensive logging system for user actions and achievements
- **Matcha Penalty System**: Created automated tracking for missed challenges with customizable rules
- **Date Management**: Implemented timezone-aware date handling for accurate daily boundaries

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully deployed static site with serverless functions
- **Environment Configuration**: Implemented secure credential management for production
- **Version Control**: Maintained comprehensive Git workflow with feature branches and automated deployments
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved fast loading times with optimized asset delivery

### Problem-Solving Highlights
- **Data Migration**: Successfully migrated from localStorage to cloud database without data loss
- **Async Programming**: Resolved complex asynchronous data loading and UI update challenges
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust fallback mechanisms for network failures
- **Debugging**: Created comprehensive logging system for production troubleshooting
